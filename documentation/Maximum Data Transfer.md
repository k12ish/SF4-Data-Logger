This implies that it takes around 1000 clock cycles to read an analogue pin!!!

Also useful:

| board  | voltage | pins     | bits    | 
|--------|---------|----------|---------|
| UNO R3 | 5 Volts | A0 to A5 | 10 bits | 

## Serial Write

A little less conclusive, but suggests a Baud Rate of 250,000 
=> 80 clock cycles per bit
=> 800 clock cycles per 10 bits!!


- Theoretical max efficiency is ~1800 clock cycles / measurement, or roughly 5kHz

- Human readable ASCII might have four bytes to describe any 10 bit unsigned int and one separator byte
- This results in 40 bits transferred, ~4200 clock cycles / measurement, or roughly 2kHz


## What Sampling rate do we need?


> Down-sampling to 500 or 250 Hz resulted in excellent concordance. Signals down-sampled to 100 Hz produced acceptable results for time-domain analysis and PoincarÃ© plots, but not for frequency-domain analysis. Down-sampling to 50 Hz proved to be unacceptable for both time- and frequency-domain analyses. At 50 Hz, the root-mean-squared successive differences and the power of high frequency tended to have high values and random errors.
